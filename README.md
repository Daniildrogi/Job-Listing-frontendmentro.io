# Frontend Mentor - Job listings with filtering
     My first attempt on intermediate level.


     I've struggled with bunch of things in thus project, one of them is still not solved - the closing of the filter options in popup window one by one. 

     The project is not well sctructed, code wise, but i pointed that to myself, as a goal for future tries. 

    I gladly will accept any help or suggestions on this issue, as well as any advices or edits.
